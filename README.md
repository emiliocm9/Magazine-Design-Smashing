# Design Teardown

This is a Heat Map clone of the web page at [smashingmagazine.com](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/#top)

The job is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy. For inspiration, check out this image from vanseodesign.com which compares a site layout with no differentiation on the left to one with a thoughtful hierarchy on the right. Your final product will look much like the site on the right.
